# Polya_Urn_Model

Based on the Polya urn model, this program will create:
1. a plot showing how the observed ratio of black balls in one Polya urn changes over 
1000 draws(steps) with given initial numbers of black balls(a) and red balls(b). 

2. a plot that compares the observed ratios of black balls in 10000 urns after 
1000 draws(steps) with given initial conditions (a, b), compared to the density function of 
the Beta(a,b) distribution. (a: the initial number of black balls; b: the initial number of red balls)
